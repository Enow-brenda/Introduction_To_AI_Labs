# Lab Four: Advanced Facial Recognition with HDBSCA  

## Overview  
This project, **Lab Four**, focuses on implementing **Advanced Facial Recognition** techniques using the **HDBSCA (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering Algorithm)**. The lab explores advanced clustering techniques to improve facial recognition accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.  

## Features  
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Organizes facial data into meaningful clusters based on density.  
- **Dynamic Adaptability**: Handles varying densities of facial feature points.  
- **Scalability**: Efficiently processes large datasets.  
- **Robustness**: Works effectively in diverse lighting and orientation conditions.  

## Prerequisites  
- **Programming Language**: Python (3.8+ recommended)  
- **Libraries**:  
  - OpenCV (image processing)  
  - NumPy (numerical computations)  
  - Scikit-learn (machine learning utilities)  
  - Matplotlib (data visualization)  
  - HDBSCAN (clustering algorithm)  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Enow-brenda/Introduction_To_AI_Labs/Lab Four Advanced Facial Recognition with HDBSCAN.git  
   cd  Lab Four Advanced Facial Recognition with HDBSCAN
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

## Usage  
1. Prepare your facial dataset and place it in the `data/` folder.  
2. Run the main script:  
   ```bash  
   python main.py  
   ```  
3. Visualize clustering and recognition results in the output folder.
